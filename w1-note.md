## Intro

Learning outcomes of week 1:

- [Aims of computer security](#information-security:-aims)
- Understanding potential vulnerabilities

---

**Do not try out anything on computers you do not own!!!**

- **It is illegal to access computers without the owner's permission.**
- **Most access are logged, and it is easy to get caught.**
- **Trying things "just for fun" could be punishable offense.**



## Learning Outcome

- Understand basic concepts of cryptography and SQL.
- Understand basic concepts of cloud services, in particular storage.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the threats to data stored on a computer, locally or in the cloud.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the threats to data sent on the network.
- Identify risks and use techniques to eliminate or mitigate them.



## Module Outline

- Cryptography
- Access Control
- Introduction to Networking
- Security Protocols
- Web Systems and Attacks
- Other Common Attacks and Defenses



## What is Computer Security

- Correctness and Efficient algorithms against an attacker.
- Information and Infrastructure
  - Sensitive data
  - Control systems
  - Hardware devices

- How to safeguard?
  - Set security goal
  - Estimate impact of attacks
  - Design mitigations
- Analyse systems, spot vulnerabilities, build protection.



## Information Security: Aims

- **Confidentiality**: attacker should not retrieve any information
- **Integrity and Authenticity**: Receive data is authentic and the sender is genuine.
- **Availability**: Data should accessible on demand.
